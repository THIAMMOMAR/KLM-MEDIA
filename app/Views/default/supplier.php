			<h2>Select Wine</h2>
			<p class="white">Pierre L. Doise, a young entrepreneur, immigrated to Vancouver B.C. in 1980. At that time consumers were starting to show interest in wines rather than beer or spirits.

Influenced by the fact that Pierre’s father had been a wine shipper in the city of London, UK, prior to WWII. Pierre founded Select Wine Merchants in 1982, focusing his efforts on fine dining restaurants buying French Cru Classés.

Within 20 years Pierre`s idea had evolved into a 1 Million case wine company across Canada, boasting relationships with many of the world’s most esteemed producers.

In 2016 Pierre completed his succession plan for Select Wines. As the next generation of the company, Chris Hoffmeister, CEO, and his senior leadership team are continuing Pierre’s legacy: building a company that is focused on growth and results, while strengthening customer relationships, and fostering a work environment where trust, respect and integrity are the dominant values.

With offices in all major markets, over 65 employees, world class systems and numerous category leading brands, Select is one of Canada’s top 5 independent import wine agencies.</p>
